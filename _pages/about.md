I am a PhD student at the University of Warsaw. My advisors are
[Prof. Joanna Tyrowicz](https://grape.org.pl/jtyrowicz) and 
[Prof. Przemyslaw Biecek](https://pbiecek.github.io/).

My research interests lie at the intersection of machine learning and economics.

Prior to my PhD, I spent 5 years working in the financial sector in London. I worked in
the Global Markets divison at BNP Paribas, where I was responsible for forecasting inflation in the Euro Area. 
Then, I worked in the Fixed Income and Macro team at Citadel, where I developed 
data-driven macroeconomic analytics and forecasting tools for macro traders and economists.

I received my MPhil degree in Economic Research from the University of Cambridge 
and my BSc degree in Economics from University College London (UCL).
During my studies, I had the opportunity to work as a research assistant with [Prof. Eric French](https://sites.google.com/site/ericfrenchecon/).
